# Python-Projects
This is a repository of all my personal python projects. All the code in this repository is written by me.

Each folder on here is it's own project with a very thorough description. These projects showcase some of my skills. They can also be found [here](https://cartermoseley.com/python-projects-2/) with more information and videos of each project in action
